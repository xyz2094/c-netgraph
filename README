Graph-network manager in C
==========================

A small command-line utility—written in C that simulates
a computer network of up to eight machines. It lets you 
create/remove weighted links, inspect the adjacency matrix, 
and trace connectivity with Depth-First Search (DFS) through 
an interactive text menu.

How to run (using MinGW): 

    > gcc computerNetworks.c -o computer_networks.exe
    > computer_networks.exe
